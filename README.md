#Home Field Advantage in NCAA Men's Division 1 Basketball Regular Season Matches
Most people in sports have heard about the perceived advantage of teams playing at their home field. 
The goal of my project is to study the measurable factors that affect a home team winning an NCAA basketball game.
The clients of my project are NCAA basketball fans, coaches, and teams. For instance, a coach of a basketball team can take into account factors that influence his team winning a game while playing at home, and use them to tune tactics for the game, and thereby taking  advantage of these factors.
