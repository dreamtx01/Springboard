        "# Abstract\n",
        "From 1985-2019, teams in the regular season  of NCAA Division 1 Men's  basketball games won 92,732 of their home games but only won  47,547 of their away games, and 15,805 of matches played in neutral locations.  This home court advantage is further confirmed with a Tukey HSD test, where the statistically significant difference between the pairs home and away games, the pairs home and neutral games, versus the pair away and neutral games was calculated.\n",
        "Many articles have explained that the reason for a team’s home-court success is the presence of fans and the arena, as opposed to the fact that they are simply the better team in a particular matchup. Assuming fans are the reasons for this home court advantage, the odds are already stacked against a visiting team, when playing these basketball matches. My first capstone project tries to analyse some of the differences between playing at home vs playing away.\n",
        "A logistic regression algorithm was used to build a model, predicting whether a match finishes 1(home win) or 2 (away win) given input derived from game statistics aggregated over a window of two past games. \n",
        "\t\n",
        "All deliverables required by this project can be found in my GitHub repository, a link to which follows:\n",
        "https://github.com/dreamtx01/Springboard/tree/master/Folders/Capstone%20Project%201\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of my capstone 1 are:\n",
        "Home court does give an advantage in basketball games played in the NCAA.\n",
        "The models predicted up to sixty-nine percent accuracy for home games when selecting all the features for the model.  \n",
        "When using top five ranked in-game statistics (features), as determined by a feature selection algorithm, the performance metrics for the model stayed the same.\n"

More specifically, the models estimate the probability of a home team winning a match. Data was partitioned into training and test for model validation. The training set included data from 2003-2018, and the test data was for the 2019 season. A performance matrix was generated both for the training and test data.\n",

However,  for the performance matrix for both the training and test data,  a low recall value was obtained for the minority class (away wins) versus the recall value obtained for the majority class (home wins).\n",
