# Home Field Advantage in NCAA Men's Division 1 Basketball Regular Season Matches

Most people in sports have heard about the perceived advantage of teams playing at their home field. 
The goal of my project is to study the measurable factors that affect a home team winning an NCAA basketball game.
The clients of my project are NCAA basketball fans, coaches, and teams. 

This information will be valuable for coaches of  basketball teams, who can take into account factors that influence their teams winning a game while playing at home. They can use these factors to tune tactics for their games, and thereby taking  advantage of these factors.
